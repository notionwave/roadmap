# VSCode

We strongly suggest VSCode as the main editor. We think that its versatility and features are unparalleled in the software industry.

## Get Started
Here are some tips and tricks that make your getting started process easier:  
  1. If you are a user of other editors (Vim, IntelliJ, Sublime, etc), try enabling the Keybinding for your editor of choice. For example search this in Extensions: `@category:"keymaps" Sublime Text`
  2. Set git use VSCode as its editor: `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`
