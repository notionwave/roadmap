# Life Style and Health

Most programmers spend much of their time writing code using the computer or thinking about how to solve problems or how to make the world a better place. the most important thing is to stay healthy and fit.
in this road map, you will learn how to stay healthy and fit.
Nothing is more than your health. as they say: "*health is wealth*"

## Body Health

it's so obvious that we can't do slightest things if we have any issues related to our body. below is a list of things related to your Body Health.

### Don't sit for too long

This is a job that usually is done by sitting in a chair and doing nothing physically. [studies](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/too-much-sitting-linked-to-heart-attack-and-stroke-even-if-active) at Harvard University show that people who sit for a long time are more likely to have a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and other serious health problems.
if you are working in an office, go to your colleagues instead of calling them. use the stairs over the elevator. anything that makes you stand up and walk for a bit is helpful.

### Stay Hydrated

Drinking more water regularly makes you a better programmer and Here's why. Water helps your kidneys, it energizes your muscles, your skin might look better and you might even lose weight when you drink more. That’s right. Less weight by drinking more. But the important thing is that when you drink a glass of water every one or two hours, it keeps your body hydrated. This means my brain is also kept hydrated. Well, and as strange as it may sound, a hydrated brain helps to focus, memorize and remember stuff way better. This leads to a better performance at your developer job.
also, lots of water made you walk to the bathroom more frequently. 

### Protect your Eyes

well, code doesn't write itself. most of the time, we are looking at the screen, wondering how to create new features or how to make the world a better place. so, we need to look after our eyes.
The most common issue programmers develop is dry eyes. when we are focused, most of the time we forgot to blink, and due to that our eyes start to get dry. using **Artificial Tears** is useful to prevent this.
Staring into a bright white monitor all day can feel like staring into a light bulb. Try turning down the brightness. If that isn’t enough, you can set your computer to display white text on black background. use Dark mode as much as you can to make your eyes comfortable.
on your browsers, you can use [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/). it's a great tool to enable dark mode on almost any website.


also, looking at objects close to your face affects your vision. try to look at objects from a distance every once in a while. There is a rule called 20-20-20. it means after looking 20 minutes at the screen, you should look at an object in your 20 meters for 20 seconds. 
there is an open-source application called [Stretchly](https://hovancik.net/stretchly/) which can help you to do this.

### Sleep well

Contrary to cool hackers’ belief, it’s not cool to sleep only four hours a night. I know that many may think that way and enjoy being a night owl, but in the long run, this will definitely not benefit your health. You need enough sleep to function properly.
It’s not only about the sleep itself. It’s also about a pleasant evening routine, where you prepare your body to go to sleep. Dimmed lights, no electronic screens (except the e-ink ones maybe), no alcohol, and so on. Ideally, you’ll go to bed at the same time every day.
Such a routine executed over weeks or even months will improve your productivity and even your overall happiness drastically.
